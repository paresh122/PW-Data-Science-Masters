The null hypothesis is that the drug has no effect on the disease, while the alternative hypothesis is that the drug does have an effect. If the clinical trial fails to reject the null hypothesis, it could be due to the drug having no effect, or it could be due to a Type II error, where the drug actually does have an effect but it was not detected in the study. In this scenario, a Type II error would occur if the new drug is effective, but the clinical trial fails to detect its effectiveness due to a small sample size or other limitations of the study."
