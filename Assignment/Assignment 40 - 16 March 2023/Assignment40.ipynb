This happens when a model learns the noise in the training data, rather than the underlying pattern, leading to a high variance. The consequence of overfitting is that the model may perform well on the training data but poorly on new data, resulting in poor generalization performance.\n",

Cross-validation involves splitting the data into multiple folds and using each fold as a test set while training on the remaining data. This helps to reduce overfitting by testing the model on unseen data. Regularization involves adding a penalty term to the objective function, which discourages the model from fitting the noise in the data. Early stopping involves stopping the training of the model when the performance on the validation set starts to degrade.\n",

Feature engineering involves creating new features from the existing ones, which can help the model to better capture the underlying pattern in the data. Increasing the model complexity by adding more layers or neurons can also help to better capture the pattern. Collecting more data can also help to reduce underfitting by providing more examples for the model to learn from."

    "### Bias refers to the difference between the expected (or average) predictions of the model and the true values of the target variable. High bias occurs when a model is too simple and unable to capture the underlying pattern in the data. This results in a significant difference between the expected predictions and the true values, resulting in underfitting. In contrast, low bias occurs when the model is complex enough to capture the underlying pattern in the data.\n",

    "### Variance refers to the amount by which the model predictions vary for different training datasets. High variance occurs when the model is too complex and fits the noise in the training data, rather than the underlying pattern. This results in a model that is sensitive to the specific training data, resulting in overfitting. In contrast, low variance occurs when the model is simple and does not fit the noise in the training data.\n",

Conversely, as the complexity of the model decreases, the bias increases, but the variance decreases.

A good model must strike a balance between bias and variance to achieve good generalization performance on new data."

    "1. Visual inspection of learning curves: Plotting the performance of the model on both the training and validation datasets over time can help identify whether the model is overfitting or underfitting. Overfitting is indicated by a large gap between the training and validation performance, while underfitting is indicated by a low overall performance.\n",

Cross-validation: Cross-validation is a technique that involves splitting the data into multiple folds and training the model on each fold, while evaluating the performance on the remaining data.

Overfitting occurs when a model fits the training data too closely and captures the noise and random fluctuations in the data, resulting in poor performance on new, unseen data. Regularization is applied to constrain the model to avoid overfitting and improve generalization performance.\n",

The penalty term discourages the model from fitting the data too closely by imposing constraints on the model's parameters.

    "1. L1 regularization (also known as Lasso regularization): This technique adds a penalty term proportional to the absolute value of the model's parameters. This results in sparse solutions where many of the model's parameters are set to zero. L1 regularization can be used to perform feature selection by effectively removing irrelevant features from the model.\n",

L2 regularization can be used to prevent overfitting and improve the generalization performance of the model.\n",
