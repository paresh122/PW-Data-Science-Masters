How to initialize repository
Create Repository on GitHub with gitignore as python and license as GNU
Create empty folder on local system
In VS Studio Code open terminal and use command: git clone "link" "local"
Make python virtual environment with command: python -m venv "local/venv"
create a requirements.txt file in which add dependencies like numpy, pandas etc
press ctrl+shift+p to Select python interpreter and select path local/venv/scripts/python.exe
